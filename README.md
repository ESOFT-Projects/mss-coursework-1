Let's use the Github flow to manage branches easily. [See more information](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

Please fork this repo and start developing on your forked repo. Let's make a pull request after the development or bugfix is done in each module.

There will be separate branches for each sub module like `feature/patient-administration` or `module/patient-administration`. Let's create more branches for larger features(eg:- `feature/register-patient` so on) when it's necessary. It's easier to fix bugs and add modifications since we are developing each module separatly.


Let's discuss more and modify this if necessary.
